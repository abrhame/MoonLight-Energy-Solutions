# solar farm data


## Overview

Data analysis and visualizations focused on the solar radiation and solar farm data, providing insights into energy efficiency and potential applications. This repository includes data processing scripts, analytical models, and visual tools to explore and optimize solar and lunar energy sources

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Scripts to clean and preprocess solar and moonlight energy data.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive visualizations using Streamlit to explore energy data.
- **Analysis**: In-depth analysis of energy efficiency and potential applications.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/abrhame/solar-farm-data
   cd MoonLight-Energy-Solutions
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/main.py
   ```

2. **Access the Dashboard**
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the dashboard.

3. **Exploring the Data**
   - Navigate through the different tabs to view various analyses and visualizations.
   - Use interactive elements like sliders and checkboxes to customize the visualizations.

## Development Process

1. **Branching and Version Control**
   - Always work on a new branch before merging changes to `main`.
   - Use descriptive commit messages for better traceability.

2. **Merging and Pull Requests**
   - Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `main` before merging.
   - Resolve conflicts and perform testing before creating a pull request.

3. **Testing**
   - Regularly test your code and visualizations locally before deploying.

## Future Directions

- **Expand Data Sources**: Integrate more data sources to enhance analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement predictive models for energy optimization.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the Streamlit app to a cloud platform for public access.

## Key Achievements

- Developed an interactive dashboard for visualizing solar and moonlight energy data.
- Performed correlation analysis to identify key relationships in the dataset.

## Limitations

- Data is limited to specific regions and timeframes.
- The current model does not account for external factors affecting energy efficiency.
